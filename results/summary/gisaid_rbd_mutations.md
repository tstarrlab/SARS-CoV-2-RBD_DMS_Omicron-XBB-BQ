# Align spike sequences in GISAID and count RBD mutations
This Python Jupyter notebook reads in a file of all spike sequences from GISAID, parses for "high-quality" sequences, builds a RBD alignment, and then makes a file that gives the counts of each mutation at each site.

## Set up analysis
Import Python modules:


```python
import io
import lzma
import os
import re
import subprocess
import tarfile

from Bio.Data.IUPACData import protein_letters
import Bio.SeqIO

from IPython.display import display, HTML

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

import pandas as pd

from plotnine import *

import yaml
```

Read the configuration file:


```python
with open('config.yaml') as f:
    config = yaml.safe_load(f)
```

Create output directory:


```python
os.makedirs(config['gisaid_mutations_dir'], exist_ok=True)
```

## Parse full-length human human spike sequences

Read the spikes from the file downloaded from GISAID:


```python
# Specify the name of the file within the tar
file_name = "spikeprot1112/spikeprot1112.fasta"

# Open the compressed file as a tar archive
with tarfile.open(config['gisaid_spikes'], "r:xz") as tar:
    # Extract the specific file from the tar archive
    file_in_tar = tar.extractfile(file_name)
    # Wrap the file_in_tar object with TextIOWrapper to open it in text mode
    file_in_tar_text = io.TextIOWrapper(file_in_tar, encoding='latin1')
    # Open the wrapped file using Bio.SeqIO.parse
    spikes = list(Bio.SeqIO.parse(file_in_tar_text, 'fasta'))

print(f"Read {len(spikes)} spike sequences.")
```

    Read 16238458 spike sequences.


Make a data frame that has the BioPython SeqRecord, length, host, and geographic location (country) for each spike.
Also determine whether sequences have ambiguous amino acids or are all valid amino acids:


```python
spikes_df = (
    pd.DataFrame({'seqrecord': spikes})
    .assign(description=lambda x: x['seqrecord'].map(lambda rec: rec.description),
            country=lambda x: x['description'].str.split('|').str[-1],
            host=lambda x: x['description'].str.split('|').str[6].str.strip(),
            length=lambda x: x['seqrecord'].map(len),
            n_ambiguous=lambda x: x['seqrecord'].map(lambda rec: rec.seq.count('X') + rec.seq.count('x')),
            )
    )
```

Show number of sequences from different hosts, then keep only human ones:


```python
display(HTML(
    spikes_df
    .groupby('host')
    .aggregate(n_sequences=pd.NamedAgg('seqrecord', 'count'))
    .sort_values('n_sequences', ascending=False)
    .to_html()
    ))

spikes_df = spikes_df.query('host == "Human"')
```

Finally, we get rid of spikes with ambiguous residues as they may hinder the alignment below.
We will then do more detailed filtering for ambiguous residues just in the RBD region after alignment (that latter part is a holdover from when max_ambiguous at the spike stage is >0, but we will keep the code for posterity):


```python
max_ambiguous = 0
print(f"Filtering sequences with > {max_ambiguous} ambiguous residues")
spikes_df = (
    spikes_df
    .assign(excess_ambiguous=lambda x: x['n_ambiguous'] > max_ambiguous)
    )
display(HTML(
    spikes_df
    .groupby('excess_ambiguous')
    .aggregate(n_sequences=pd.NamedAgg('seqrecord', 'count'))
    .to_html()
    ))


spikes_df = spikes_df.query('~excess_ambiguous')
```

## Align the RBD region of the spikes
We now align the RBD regions of the spikes.
We do this **before** we filter sequences with too many ambiguous residues so that we can do that filtering just on the RBD region.

We align with `mafft` using the `--addfragments` and `--keeplength` options (see [here](https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/closelyrelatedviralgenomes.html) and [here](https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/addsequences.html)) to align relative to a reference that is just the RBD; these options also clip the sequences relative to the reference.
Note that these options make sense if the following conditions are met:
  1. Sequences are all very similar.
  2. We are not worried about insertions.
For now, both of these appear to be true, but this choice should be kept in mind if there is a lot more divergence or insertions.

We align relative to the reference that is the wildtype sequence used for the experiments:


```python
print(f"Reading reference nucleotide sequence in {config['wildtype_sequence']}")
refseq = Bio.SeqIO.read(config['wildtype_sequence'], 'fasta')

refprotfile = os.path.join(config['gisaid_mutations_dir'], 'reference_RBD.fasta')
print(f"Writing protein translation of reference sequence to {refprotfile}")
refseq.seq = refseq.seq.translate()
_ = Bio.SeqIO.write(refseq, refprotfile, 'fasta')
```

    Reading reference nucleotide sequence in data/wildtype_sequence.fasta
    Writing protein translation of reference sequence to results/GISAID_mutations/reference_RBD.fasta


Write all the other spikes to a file:


```python
# spikes_file = os.path.join(config['gisaid_mutations_dir'],
#                            'human_full-length_spikes.fasta')
# print(f"Writing the spikes to {spikes_file}")
# _ = Bio.SeqIO.write(spikes_df['seqrecord'].tolist(), spikes_file, 'fasta')
```

Now make the alignment.
Note that we use multiple threads to speed things up, and also align the spikes in chunks.
The reason that we have to the chunkwise alignment is that some unclear `mafft` error was arising if we tried to align them all at once:


```python
chunksize = 50000

aligned_rbds = []

for i in range(0, len(spikes_df), chunksize):
    spikes_file = os.path.join(config['gisaid_mutations_dir'],
                               f"human_full-length_spikes_{i + 1}-to-{i + chunksize}.fasta")
    print(f"Writing spikes {i + 1} to {i + chunksize} to {spikes_file}")
    _ = Bio.SeqIO.write(spikes_df['seqrecord'].tolist()[i: i + chunksize], spikes_file, 'fasta')
    print('Now aligning these sequences...')
    cmds = ['mafft', '--auto', '--thread', str(config['max_cpus']),
            '--keeplength', '--addfragments', spikes_file, refprotfile]
    res = subprocess.run(cmds, capture_output=True)
    if res.returncode:
        raise RuntimeError(f"Error in alignment:\n{res.stderr}")
    else:
        print('Alignment complete.\n')
        with io.StringIO(res.stdout.decode('latin1')) as f:
            iseqs = list(Bio.SeqIO.parse(f, 'fasta'))
            # remove reference sequence, which should be first in file
            assert iseqs[0].seq == refseq.seq and iseqs[0].description == refseq.description
            iseqs = iseqs[1:]
            assert len(iseqs) == min(chunksize, len(spikes_df) - i)
            aligned_rbds += iseqs
            
assert len(aligned_rbds) == len(spikes_df)

## Parse / filter aligned RBDs

Now put all of the aligned RBDs into a data frame to filter and parse:


```python
rbd_df = (
    pd.DataFrame({'seqrecord': aligned_rbds})
    .assign(description=lambda x: x['seqrecord'].map(lambda rec: rec.description),
            country=lambda x: x['description'].str.split('|').str[-1],
            host=lambda x: x['description'].str.split('|').str[6].str.strip(),
            length=lambda x: x['seqrecord'].map(len),
            n_ambiguous=lambda x: x['seqrecord'].map(lambda rec: rec.seq.count('X') + rec.seq.count('x')),
            n_gaps=lambda x: x['seqrecord'].map(lambda rec: rec.seq.count('-')),
            all_valid_aas=lambda x: x['seqrecord'].map(lambda rec: re.fullmatch(f"[{protein_letters}]+",
                                                                                str(rec.seq)) is not None),
            )
    )

assert all(rbd_df['length'] == len(refseq))
```

Plot number of gaps and ambiguous nucleotides among sequences:


```python
for prop in ['n_ambiguous', 'n_gaps']:
    p = (ggplot(rbd_df) +
         aes(prop) +
         ylab('number of sequences') +
         theme(figure_size=(10, 2.5)) +
         geom_bar()
         )
    _ = p.draw()
```

Based on above plots, we will retain just RBDs with no ambiguous amino acids and no more than 3 gaps (sequecnes with many deletions appear to be quite artefactual / nonsensical):


```python
rbd_df = rbd_df.query('n_ambiguous == 0').query('n_gaps < 2')
print(f"Retained {len(rbd_df)} RBDs.")
```

    Retained 9811285 RBDs.


Now get and plot the number of amino-acid mutations per RBD relative to the reference sequence, plotting on both a linear and log scale.
We then filter all RBDs that have more than some maximum number of mutations, based on the idea that ones that are extremely highly mutated probably are erroneous.
**Note that this maximum number of mutations will change over time, so should be re-assessed periodically by looking at below plots.**


```python
max_muts = 50

refseq_str = str(refseq.seq)
rbd_df = (
    rbd_df
    .assign(seq=lambda x: x['seqrecord'].map(lambda rec: str(rec.seq)),
            n_mutations=lambda x: x['seq'].map(lambda s: sum(x != y for x, y in zip(s, refseq_str))))
    )

p = (ggplot(rbd_df) +
     aes('n_mutations') +
     geom_bar() +
     theme(figure_size=(10, 2.5)) +
     geom_vline(xintercept=max_muts + 0.5, color='red', linetype='dotted')
     )
_ = p.draw()
_ = (p + scale_y_log10()).draw()

rbd_df = rbd_df.query('n_mutations <= @max_muts')
```

Write RBD sequences that pass filtering to a file:


```python
print(f"Overall, there are {len(rbd_df)} aligned RBDs that passed filters.")

rbd_alignment_file = os.path.join(config['gisaid_mutations_dir'], 'RBD_alignment.fasta')
print(f"Writing alignment to {rbd_alignment_file}")
_ = Bio.SeqIO.write(rbd_df['seqrecord'].tolist(), rbd_alignment_file, 'fasta')
```

    Overall, there are 9811285 aligned RBDs that passed filters.
    Writing alignment to results/GISAID_mutations/RBD_alignment.fasta


## Get counts of each mutation
Now we get a data frame that gives the count of each mutation at each site:


```python
records = []
for tup in rbd_df[['seq', 'country']].itertuples():
    for isite, (mut, wt) in enumerate(zip(tup.seq, refseq_str), start=1):
        if mut != wt:
            records.append((isite, isite + config['site_number_offset'], wt, mut, tup.country))
            
muts_df = (pd.DataFrame.from_records(records,
                                     columns=['isite', 'site', 'wildtype', 'mutant', 'country'])
           .groupby(['isite', 'site', 'wildtype', 'mutant'])
           .aggregate(count=pd.NamedAgg('country', 'count'),
                      n_countries=pd.NamedAgg('country', 'nunique'))
           .reset_index()
           .sort_values('count', ascending=False)
           .assign(frequency=lambda x: x['count'] / len(rbd_df))
           )

print('Here are first few lines of mutation counts data frame:')
display(HTML(muts_df.head(n=15).to_html(index=False)))
```

    Here are first few lines of mutation counts data frame:

Plot how many mutations are observed how many times:


```python
p = (ggplot(muts_df) +
     aes('count') +
     geom_histogram(bins=20) +
     scale_x_log10() +
     ylab('number of sequences') +
     xlab('times mutation observed')
     )

_ = p.draw()
```

Write the mutation counts to a file:


```python
print(f"Writing mutation counts to {config['gisaid_mutation_counts']}")
muts_df.to_csv(config['gisaid_mutation_counts'], index=False)
```

    Writing mutation counts to results/GISAID_mutations/mutation_counts.csv
